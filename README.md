# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Creating a Movies Website which displays the movies along with a play button which opens their trailer link.


Using React for front end UI and the data we are getting from the API which we created and available in the main branch of this repository.

// Todo: Talk about React Carousel, navigator


// Todo: Mention clearly about React Player and other css styles that used to create the front end application.
